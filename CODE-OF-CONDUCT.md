# Code of Conduct

## Summary

This Code of Conduct is our way to encourage good behavior and discourage bad behavior in our community. We expect participants to communicate professionally and thoughtfully. This code does not replace the terms of service or acceptable use policies of the websites used to support this project. We acknowledge that participants may be subject to additional conduct terms based on their employment which may govern their online expressions. 

## Details

This Code of Conduct makes our expectations of participants in this community explicit.

* We forbid harassing and abusive speech within this project/community.
* We urge participants to refrain from using this project to engage in a fight.
* We request participants to report misconduct to the project’s Response Team.
* We may remove participants from the project's forums if find they violate this code.
* You may contact the Response Team via tbd@elavon.com

### Expected Behaviors

We expect participants in this community to conduct themselves professionally. Since our primary mode of communication is text on an online forum (e.g. issues, pull requests, comments, emails, or chats) lacking vocal tone, gestures, or other context that is often vital to understanding, it is important that participants are attentive to their interaction style.

* **Assume positive intent.** We ask community members to assume positive intent on the part of other people’s communications. We may disagree on details, but we expect all suggestions to be supportive of the community goals.
* **Respect participants.** We expect occasional disagreements. Open Source projects are learning experiences. Ask, explore, challenge, and then _respectfully_ state if you agree or disagree. If your idea is rejected, be more persuasive not bitter.
* **Welcoming to new members.** New members bring new perspectives. Some ask questions that have been addressed before. _Kindly_ point to existing discussions. Everyone is new to every project once.
* **Be kind to beginners.** Beginners use open source projects to get experience. They might not be talented coders yet, and projects should not accept poor quality code. But we were all beginners once, and we need to engage kindly.
* **Consider your impact on others.** Your work will be used by others, and you depend on the work of others. We expect community members to be considerate and establish a balance their self-interest with communal interest.
* **Use words carefully.** We may not understand intent when you say something ironic. Often, people will misinterpret sarcasm in online communications. We ask community members to communicate plainly.
* **Leave with grace.** When you wish to resign from participating in this project for any reason, you are free to fork the code and create a competitive project. Open Source explicitly allows this. Your exit should not be dramatic or bitter.

### Unacceptable Behaviors

Participants remain in good standing when they do not engage in misconduct or harassment (some examples follow). We do not list all forms of harassment, nor imply some forms of harassment are not worthy of action. Any participant who *feels* harassed or *observes* harassment, may engage with the Response Team.

* **Don't be a bigot.** Calling out project members by their identity or background in a negative or insulting manner. This includes, but is not limited to, slurs or insinuations related to protected or suspect classes e.g. race, color, citizenship, national origin, political belief, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, culture, ethnicity, genetic features, language, profession, national minority status, mental or physical ability.
* **Don't insult.** Insulting remarks about a person’s lifestyle practices.
* **Don't dox.** Revealing private information about other participants without explicit permission.
* **Don't intimidate.** Threats of violence or intimidation of any project member.
* **Don't creep.** Unwanted sexual attention or content unsuited for the subject of this project.
* **Don't inflame.** We ask that victim of harassment not address their grievances in the public forum, as this often intensifies the problem. Report it, and let us address it off-line.
* **Don't disrupt.** Sustained disruptions in a discussion.

### Scope

This code does not replace the terms of service or acceptable use policies that are provided by the websites used to support this community. Nor does this code apply to communications or actions that take place outside of the context of this community. Many participants in this project are also subject to codes of conduct based on their employment. This code is a social-contract that informs participants of our social expectations. It is not a terms of service or legal contract.
